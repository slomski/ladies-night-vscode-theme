# Ladies Night VS Code theme

## This theme is based on a popular [Ladies Night 2](http://color-themes.com/?view=theme&id=566065a4ddacef1b003edb63) theme for IntelliJ

After moving from IntelliJ to VS Code i wanted to keep my favourite theme so i created this.

### Tokenizers

At the moment theme has tokenizers defined for

- js
- jsx
- html
- markdown

I will add Java and TS in the future

### Theme with Consolas font:
